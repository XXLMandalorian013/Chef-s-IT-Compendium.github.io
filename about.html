          Hello, my name is Drew McClellan. I wrote this website myself with html + css and have it hosted on GitHub Pages. I hope you find something useful!
        </p>

        <p>
          Before working in IT, I used to work in food service and had been a Chef for over a decade. I love food and always have, it’s what I went to school for. 
          During Covid I got “furloughed”. Having “a bad feeling about this” and having never been one to have idle hands, I decided to look for a new job. That’s when I broke into IT!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I have always been interested in Tech and build my own gaming PCs. I also was the de facto Tech support to my family and friends and still happily am.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Switching to IT was a bit of a change for me but I can't believe I had not started in IT sooner! My first position in IT was as an IT Support Specialist.
          My first year was mostly help desk for both company’s office’s supporting the users in office and those remotely working and all of their software/hardware issues.
          In my second year, I still support all our users now back in office but started to take on more projects from the IT Manager. This is also when I started to venture into learning PowerShell. 
          At the same time, I was also beginning to draft CAD electrical/technology drawings and set up projects.
          In my third year, I have been promoted to Jr. System Administrator. I still maintain all my past duties as well as on-boarding/off-boarding, managing our software installers, creating conditional access policies in Azure, digesting user risk reports, maintain a Hyper-V test environment, manage backups, and the company GitHub Repository.
        </p>

        <p>
          Really running with IT, I then set my sights on new horizons and took a job as at an MSP as a Jr. System Administrator. They offer co to full IT managed services, several data centers providing Cloud services (IaaS, DR, BaaS PB-X), Network managed services (DAI, SDWAN, and MPLS).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I never thought I'd say I enjoyed learning as my Dyslexia in school made me feel like I was never really that smart, but the crazy fun part of IT is always learning something new, and Monday is never the same as mid-week or Friday. 
          At home I created a home-lab consisting of a Win Sever 19 with hardware RAID and my gaming rig hosting Win and Linux VM’s. I also attend digital PowerShell meetups quite often.
          I can't say that I'll be in IT forever as I never thought I was going to leave food service, but I don't think I could ever go back to food service or any other job.
